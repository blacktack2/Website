<p>
    The Clusters Simulation application is a C++ project based on
    <a href="https://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/">Jeffrey Ventrella's Clusters Simulation</a>,
    and inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kx4Y9TVMGg">this</a> YouTube video.
</p>
<p>
    I primarily made this application to learn C++, so while some of the code itself is messy and
    poorly optimized, I am still quite proud of the result. The application uses compute shaders to
    run the simulation more efficiently (cmake builds two executables, one for CPU and one for GPU,
    so they can be compared). Using compute shaders gives me an increase in performance of up to 10
    times, compared to using CPU only.
</p>
<p>
    This simulation involves creating several <b>Atoms</b> and <b>Atom Types</b>, and defining how
    Atoms of different Types interact (either attracting, repelling, or completely ignoring each other).
    Different configurations create emergent behaviour which resemble life-like structures (in particular,
    really simple cells).

    See below for a simple JavaScript version of this simulation.

<h2>Structures</h2>

<p>
    Here I provide some examples of the emergent behaviour that can be seen in this simulation.
</p>

<h3>Cells</h3>

<p>
    I denote cells as emergent structures which maintain stable ring-like forms. Many cells will be robust,
    even in the presence of distruptive chasers, though some may be fragile and break apart after only a short
    time. Occasionally they oscillate between multiple states, and there is some overlap with spinners.
</p>
<p>
    Terms:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tier-N - Tier of the cell, where N is number of Atom Types a cell is composed of.</li>
    <li>Oscillator - Oscillates between two or more patterns over time</li>
</ul>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Tier-2 Cells</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T2Cell0.png" alt="Tier-2 Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T2Cell1.png" alt="Tier-2 Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Tier-3 Cells</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3Cell0.png" alt="Tier-3 Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3Cell1.png" alt="Tier-3 Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Tier-2 Oscillators</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T2CellOscillator0_0.png" alt="Tier-2 Oscillator Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T2CellOscillator0_1.png" alt="Tier-2 Oscillator Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Tier-3 Oscillators</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3CellOscillator0_0.png" alt="Tier-3 Oscillator Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3CellOscillator0_1.png" alt="Tier-3 Oscillator Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3CellOscillator0_2.png" alt="Tier-3 Oscillator Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3CellOscillator0_3.png" alt="Tier-3 Oscillator Cell image" width="200" height="200" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Chasers</h3>

<p>
    I denote chasers as emergent structures which persistantly move. Usually they consist of a head and a tail.
    Most of the time chasers will move erratically, often colliding into each other and either combining into a
    larger chaser, breaking apart, or even combining into a stable cell.
</p>
<p>
    Terms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tier-H-T - Tier of the chaser, where H is the number of heads, and T is the number of tails. </li>
    <li>Head - Usually orb-like structures at the front of the chaser.</li>
    <li>Tail - Longer trails of Atoms which chase after the head.</li>
</ul>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Tier-4 Chasers</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T4Chaser0.png" alt="Tier-4 Chaser image" height="200" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Spinners</h3>

<p>
    I denote spinners as emergent structures which appear to contain nodes which spin around each other in an
    orbiting-like manner. These are more common when there are a lot of atom types.
</p>
<p>
    Terms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tier-N - Tier of the spinner, where N is the number of nodes.</li>
    <li>Node - Usually orb-shaped cluster of a single Atom Type composing one part of the spinner.</li>
</ul>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Tier-3 Spinners</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3Spinner0_0.png" alt="Tier-3 Spinner image" height="200" /></td>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3Spinner0_1.png" alt="Tier-3 Spinner image" height="200" /></td>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3Spinner0_2.png" alt="Tier-3 Spinner image" height="200" /></td>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/clusters/T3Spinner0_3.png" alt="Tier-3 Spinner image" height="200" /></td>
    </tr>
