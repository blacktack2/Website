<p>
    During the second semester of my Masters course (MSComp Computer Science - Game Engineering 4<sup>th</sup> year)
    I was tasked with building a 3D game, alongside a group of eight people (myself included). The theme for this project
    was Splatoon, with a particular focus on the paint mechanic.
</p>
<p>
    My primary responsibility in this group was with Graphics, though I did delve into most areas of the project. The initial
    framework for our project was built on top of my submission for the previous
    <a href="/portfolio/MastersPhysics.html">Physics Coursework</a> (which in turn was built on a framework provided by Richard
    Davidson, one of our lecturers).
</p>
<p>
    The other members of my group were as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Daniel T. Abraham</li>
    <li>Harry G. Brettell</li>
    <li>Cho Hin Chiu (Felix)</li>
    <li>Yifei Hu</li>
    <li>Sashwat Kashyap (Kash)</li>
    <li>Shantao. Liu</li>
    <li>Xiaoyang Liu</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>

<h3>Graphics</h3>

<p>
    Many of the techniques I discuss here are based on <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">these tutorials</a>. Take a look if you're
    interested in a more in-depth look at how specific techniques are done.
</p>
<p>
    The first major thing I did for this project was to overhaul the render pipeline. Originally, my physics coursework made no changes
    to the rendering framework provided (as there was no need), so all of the rendering code was found in a few member functions
    of the GameTechRenderer class.
</p>
<p>
    My solution to this was to build a render-pass system in which we could extend a base RenderPass class for each major part of the
    render pipeline and have the renderer build a list of passes which it will iterate through during the mainloop. Over time I extended
    this structure to differentiate between different types of render passes, with main passes (rendering to the GBuffer), post-processing
    passes (applying effects to an already drawn scene), and overlay passes (drawing on top of the backbuffer).
</p>
<p>
    The following diagram roughly outlines the final full render pipeline:
</p>

<p>
    Many of the systems I made for this project's render pipeline were designed to be platform agnostic. Data structures, like textures
    and framebuffers, were encapsulated in base classes which hold public member functions for all the functionality one would need when
    handling them. Specific implementations (in particular OpenGL and PS4) would then extend these base classes, with per-platform
    code to handle the actual API calls (i.e. <code>Shader.Bind()</code> would use <code>glUseProgram()</code> for OpenGL, and configure a
    <code>GnmxGfxContext</code> for PS4). This was mainly done to allow easier porting to PS4, though unfortunately we never fully got
    around to this.
</p>

<h4>Painting Pass</h4>
<p>
    This pass takes in every model with a paint texture, and writes to the texture any new paint splats which have occured since
    the previous frame. The results are then used later in the model pass to inform the albedo of a model.
</p>

<h4>Skybox</h4>
<p>
    A <b>procedural skybox</b> is generated using the same code from my <a href="/portfolio/MastersGraphics.html">Graphics Coursework</a>.
    The skybox is configurable, allowing for a dynamic sun direction and varying amounts of cumulus and cirrus clouds. The clouds
    are generated using simplex noise, skewed to account for perspective. Mie scattering and Reyleigh scattering calculations are
    used to generate the actual sky.
</p>
<p>
    The code used for the skybox was originally sourced from <a href="https://github.com/shff/opengl_sky">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Output texture for this pass:

<h4>Model</h4>
<p>
    Models with a RenderObject are drawn to the GBuffer, filling in textures for albedo, normal (with <b>bump-mapping</b>,
    and <b>parallax-mapping</b>), <b>specular-mapping</b>, and depth.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Animations</b> (seen with the player character and the boss) were originally done by Sean, though I did go through and overhaul it
    to fix some bugs and make it better fit with the structure of our project.
</p>
<p>
    Output textures for this pass:

<h4>Lighting</h4>
<p>
    The final scene in our game only uses a single directional light for the sun (though functionality exists for multiple
    lights, as well as point and spot lights). Lighting is calculated using the <b>Blinn-Phong</b> reflection model, with <b>shadow mapping</b>
    to cast per-light-source shadows. The spec-map texture generated during the model pass is also used here to weight the amount
    of specular light a given surface can have.
</p>
<p>
    Output texture for the main directional light's shadow map:

<h4>SSAO (Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion)</h4>
<p>
    Ambient occlusion is generated using 64 kernels with a radius of 0.5 (about half the player's radius). All parameters
    are configurable, with the kernels handled via SSBO to allow resizing.
</p>
<p>
    Output texture for this pass:
</p>

<h4>Combine</h4>
<p>
    This pass takes all elements of the GBuffer and combines them into a single output texture. It is here that
    the final lighting calculations occur, combining the skybox, albedo, diffuse, specular, and ambient occlusion.
    Different modes have also been added for debug purposes allowing to switch to only rendering certain textures,
    like the depth or normal textures.
</p>
<p>
    This pass also marks the end of the main stage of the render pipeline, with the next passes being
    post-processing effects.
</p>
<p>
    Output texture for this pass:

<h4>Bloom</h4>
<p>
    Though barely visible in the final project, due to a lack of bright objects, physically based bloom is generated
    during this pass. This is done by downsampling then upsampling the scene to create a blurry texture, which is
    then added back to the original scene to create the bloom effect.
</p>

<h4>HDR (High Dynamic Range)</h4>
<p>
    Though I didn't have the time to implement automatic eye adjustment, I was able to implement HDR. This pass is very
    simple, taking a single exposure parameter to increase or decrease the overall brightness of the image.
</p>

<h4>Presentation</h4>
<p>
    This pass takes the final texture of post-processing and draws it directly to the backbuffer, with <b>gamma correction</b>
    applied. All remaining passes are overlay passes, which draw on top of this scene.
</p>

<h4>HUD</h4>
<p>
    This pass was created by another group member, though I did help fix a few bugs in it. The main purpose of the HUD pass is
    to draw health bars, done via drawing textures to quads using the same shader as the menu pass.
</p>

<h4>Debug</h4>
<p>
    In the original framework from Richard Davidson, debug text and lines were drawn by filling static lists of vertex and uv
    information, which would then be used at the end of the render-pipeline. I took this system and plugged it into it's own
    render pass, as well as making it platform agnostic to fit the rest of my redesigned framework.

<h4>Menu</h4>
<p>
    This pass was created by Yifei, with my assistance. I also redesigned much of the menu system to use a nested structure,
    allowing for widgets to have child widgets which are recursively drawn. Individual components are drawn as textured quads,
    using a texture matrix to offset and scale the vertices to their correct positions.
