<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<h3>Programming</h3>

<p>
I program as part of work, and just for fun. You can see a few of my projects in the <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> section.
</p>

<h3>Puzzles</h3>

<p>
I always enjoy solving puzzles, though I can't say if I'm any good. In particular I have an ongoing collection of <a href="">twisty puzzles (Rubik's cubes)</a>.
</p>

<h3>Video Games</h3>

<p>
I frequently play video games in my free time, in particular I enjoy puzzle games, strategy games, roguelikes, and sandbox games.
</p>
<p>
A few of the games I tend to play include Minecraft, Hades, Civ6, Opus Magnum.
</p>

<h3>Piano</h3>

<p>
I used to take lessons, now I just play for fun. Many of the songs I can play are covers from games I like, but I also know a few classical pieces.
</p>

<h3>Art</h3>

<p>
I haven't done a lot of art recently, but I still enjoy drawing. I'm most used to pencil drawings, but I also do some graphical art.
